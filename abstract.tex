Adaptive immunity is a highly active branch of biology dealing with issues that are relevant for understanding and treating a wide range of human diseases as well as basic understanding of human physiology.
B cell and their B cell receptors (BCRs) have a central role in the adaptive immune system e.g.\ in vaccine immunity caused by antibodies and autoimmune diseases.
Adaptivity of BCRs stem from the Darwinian evolution in which B cells are matured in the germinal center (GC) to specifically neutralize foreign antigen, but it has only recently been possible to study this in details by using high throughput sequencing (HTS).
An important objective of these HTS studies is to reconstruct the phylogeny of the GC evolutionary process such that it is possible to understand the developmental path of immunity.
Tools and theory for inferring phylogenies are already developed and tested, however most have been developed to study population genetics or evolution of organisms over millions of years, while BCR evolution occurs under very different conditions.
We have setup a simulation framework of BCR evolution under both a neutral, and an affinity selection model derive to represent realistic BCR sequence evolution where the fitness function is coupled to antigen affinity.
We simulate data to recapitulate summary statistics of real BCR data and use a number of different phylogenetic methods to infer the simulated phylogenies.
Using the true and inferred phylogenies we perform a validation to assess the topological similarities and the correctness of the ancestral sequence reconstruction, measured by a novel metric we call COAR.
Our results show that phylogenetic inference is robust to both simple and advanced simulations and that sequence reconstruction is largely insensitive to the choice of methods in out tests.
This confirms the validity of using standard phylogenetic inference on GC evolved BCR sequences, regardless of its unconventional evolutionary nature.
