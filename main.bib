  author   = "Hoehn, Kenneth and Lunter, Gerton and Pybus, Oliver",
  abstract = "Phylogenetic methods have shown promise in understanding the
              development of broadly neutralizing antibody lineages (bNAbs).
              However, the mutational process that generates these
              lineages---somatic hypermutation (SHM)---is biased by hotspot
              motifs, which violates important assumptions in most phylogenetic
              substitution models. Here, we develop a modified GY94-type
              substitution model that partially accounts for this
              context-dependency while preserving independence of sites during
              calculation. This model shows a substantially better fit to three
              well-characterized bNAb lineages than the standard GY94 model. We
              show through simulations that accounting for hotspot motifs can
              lead to reduced bias of other substitution parameters, and more
              accurate ancestral state reconstructions. We also demonstrate how
              our model can be used to test hypotheses concerning the roles of
              different hotspot and coldspot motifs in the evolution of B-cell
              lineages. Further, we explore the consequences of the idea that
              the number of hotspot motifs---and perhaps the mutation rate in
              general---is expected to decay over time in individual bNAb
              lineages.",

                 method that has revealed many key mechanisms of molecular
                 evolution. One criticism of the approach is an inability to
                 validate its algorithms within a biological context as opposed
                 to a computer simulation. Here we build an experimental
                 phylogeny using the gene of a single red fluorescent protein
                 to address this criticism. The evolved phylogeny consists of
                 19 operational taxonomic units (leaves) and 17 ancestral
                 bifurcations (nodes) that display a wide variety of
                 fluorescent phenotypes. The 19 leaves then serve as 'modern'
                 sequences that we subject to ASR analyses using various
                 algorithms and to benchmark against the known ancestral
                 genotypes and ancestral phenotypes. We confirm computer
                 simulations that show all algorithms infer ancient sequences
                 with high accuracy, yet we also reveal wide variation in the
                 phenotypes encoded by incorrectly inferred sequences.
                 Specifically, Bayesian methods incorporating rate variation
                 significantly outperform the maximum parsimony criterion in

  abstract    = "The phylogenetic inference of ancestral protein sequences is a
                 powerful technique for the study of molecular evolution, but
                 any conclusions drawn from such studies are only as good as
                 the accuracy of the reconstruction method. Every inference
                 method leads to errors in the ancestral protein sequence,
                 resulting in potentially misleading estimates of the ancestral
                 protein's properties. To assess the accuracy of ancestral
                 protein reconstruction methods, we performed computational
                 population evolution simulations featuring near-neutral
                 evolution under purifying selection, speciation, and
                 divergence using an off-lattice protein model where fitness
                 depends on the ability to be stable in a specified target
                 structure. We were thus able to compare the thermodynamic
                 properties of the true ancestral sequences with the properties
                 of ``ancestral sequences'' inferred by maximum parsimony,
                 maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods. Surprisingly, we
                 found that methods such as maximum parsimony and maximum
                 likelihood that reconstruct a ``best guess'' amino acid at
                 each position overestimate thermostability, while a Bayesian
                 method that sometimes chooses less-probable residues from the
                 posterior probability distribution does not. Maximum
                 likelihood and maximum parsimony apparently tend to eliminate
                 variants at a position that are slightly detrimental to
                 structural stability simply because such detrimental variants
                 are less frequent. Other properties of ancestral proteins
                 might be similarly overestimated. This suggests that ancestral
                 reconstruction studies require greater care to come to
                 credible conclusions regarding functional evolution. Inferred
                 functional patterns that mimic reconstruction bias should be
                 reevaluated.",

                 formulate and test hypotheses about the sequences, functions,
                 and structures of ancient genes. Ancestral sequences are
                 usually inferred from an alignment of extant sequences using a
                 maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic algorithm, which
                 calculates the most likely ancestral sequence assuming a
                 probabilistic model of sequence evolution and a specific
                 phylogeny--typically the tree with the ML. The true phylogeny
                 is seldom known with certainty, however. ML methods ignore
                 this uncertainty, whereas Bayesian methods incorporate it by
                 integrating the likelihood of each ancestral state over a
                 distribution of possible trees. It is not known whether
                 Bayesian approaches to phylogenetic uncertainty improve the
                 accuracy of inferred ancestral sequences. Here, we use
                 simulation-based experiments under both simplified and
                 empirically derived conditions to compare the accuracy of ASR
                 carried out using ML and Bayesian approaches. We show that
                 incorporating phylogenetic uncertainty by integrating over
                 topologies very rarely changes the inferred ancestral state
                 and does not improve the accuracy of the reconstructed
                 ancestral sequence. Ancestral state reconstructions are robust
                 to uncertainty about the underlying tree because the
                 conditions that produce phylogenetic uncertainty also make the
                 ancestral state identical across plausible trees; conversely,
                 the conditions under which different phylogenies yield
                 different inferred ancestral states produce little or no
                 ambiguity about the true phylogeny. Our results suggest that
                 ML can produce accurate ASRs, even in the face of phylogenetic
                 uncertainty. Using Bayesian integration to incorporate this
                 uncertainty is neither necessary nor beneficial.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is increasingly used
                 in diagnostics and surveillance of infectious diseases. A
                 major application for WGS is to use the data for identifying
                 outbreak clusters, and there is therefore a need for methods
                 that can accurately and efficiently infer phylogenies from
                 sequencing reads. In the present study we describe a new
                 dataset that we have created for the purpose of benchmarking
                 such WGS-based methods for epidemiological data, and also
                 present an analysis where we use the data to compare the
                 performance of some current methods. RESULTS: Our aim was to
                 create a benchmark data set that mimics sequencing data of the
                 sort that might be collected during an outbreak of an
                 infectious disease. This was achieved by letting an E. coli
                 hypermutator strain grow in the lab for 8 consecutive days,
                 each day splitting the culture in two while also collecting
                 samples for sequencing. The result is a data set consisting of
                 101 whole genome sequences with known phylogenetic
                 relationship. Among the sequenced samples 51 correspond to
                 internal nodes in the phylogeny because they are ancestral,
                 while the remaining 50 correspond to leaves. We also used the
                 newly created data set to compare three different online
                 available methods that infer phylogenies from whole-genome
                 sequencing reads: NDtree, CSI Phylogeny and REALPHY. One
                 complication when comparing the output of these methods with
                 the known phylogeny is that phylogenetic methods typically
                 build trees where all observed sequences are placed as leafs,
                 even though some of them are in fact ancestral. We therefore
                 devised a method for post processing the inferred trees by
                 collapsing short branches (thus relocating some leafs to
                 internal nodes), and also present two new measures of tree
                 similarity that takes into account the identity of both
                 internal and leaf nodes. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this analysis
                 we find that, among the investigated methods, CSI Phylogeny
                 had the best performance, correctly identifying 73\% of all
                 branches in the tree and 71\% of all clades. We have made all
                 data from this experiment (raw sequencing reads, consensus
                 whole-genome sequences, as well as descriptions of the known
                 phylogeny in a variety of formats) publicly available, with
                 the hope that other groups may find this data useful for
                 benchmarking and exploring the performance of epidemiological
                 methods. All data is freely available at:

                 all positions of the variable domains of a high-affinity
                 anti-VEGF antibody G6.31 impact its antigen-binding function.

  abstract    = "Macromolecular function is rooted in energy landscapes, where
                 sequence determines not a single structure but an ensemble of
                 conformations. Hence, evolution modifies a protein's function
                 by altering its energy landscape. Here, we recreate the
                 evolutionary pathway between two modern human oncogenes, Src
                 and Abl, by reconstructing their common ancestors. Our
                 evolutionary reconstruction combined with x-ray structures of
                 the common ancestor and pre-steady-state kinetics reveals a
                 detailed atomistic mechanism for selectivity of the successful
                 cancer drug Gleevec. Gleevec affinity is gained during the
                 evolutionary trajectory toward Abl and lost toward Src,
                 primarily by shifting an induced-fit equilibrium that is also
                 disrupted in the clinical T315I resistance mutation. This work
                 reveals the mechanism of Gleevec specificity while offering

While some pathogens such as measles present a few relatively invariant targets to the immune system, others such as malaria display considerable antigenic diversity. How the immune response copes in the presence of multiple antigens, and whether a trade-off exists between the breadth and efficacy of antibody (Ab)-mediated immune responses, are unsolved problems. We present a theoretical model of affinity maturation of B-cell receptors (BCRs) during a primary infection and examine how variation in the number of accessible antigenic sites alters the Ab repertoire. Naive B cells with randomly generated receptor sequences initiate the germinal centre (GC) reaction. The binding affinity of a BCR to an antigen is quantified via a genotype-phenotype map, based on a random energy landscape, that combines local and distant interactions between residues. In the presence of numerous antigens or epitopes, B-cell clones with different specificities compete for stimulation during rounds of mutation within GCs. We find that the availability of many epitopes reduces the affinity and relative breadth of the Ab repertoire. Despite the stochasticity of somatic hypermutation, patterns of immunodominance are strongly shaped by chance selection of naive B cells with specificities for particular epitopes. Our model provides a mechanistic basis for the diversity of Ab repertoires and the evolutionary advantage of antigenically complex pathogens.}, number={1676}, journal={Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

We explored the population dynamics of genetically diverse GC responses to two complex antigens-Bacillus anthracis protective antigen and influenza hemagglutinin-in which B cells competed both intra- and interclonally for distinct epitopes. Preferred VH rearrangements among antigen-binding, naive B cells were similarly abundant in early GCs but, unlike responses to haptens, clonal diversity increased in GC B cells as early “winners” were replaced by rarer, high-affinity clones. Despite affinity maturation, inter- and intraclonal avidities varied greatly, and half of GC B cells did not bind the immunogen but nonetheless exhibited biased VH use, V(D)J mutation, and clonal expansion comparable to antigen-binding cells.

                 validate its algorithms within a biological context as opposed

                 19 operational taxonomic units (leaves) and 17 ancestral

                 powerful technique for the study of molecular evolution, but
                 any conclusions drawn from such studies are only as good as
                 the accuracy of the reconstruction method. Every inference
                 method leads to errors in the ancestral protein sequence,
                 resulting in potentially misleading estimates of the ancestral
                 protein's properties. To assess the accuracy of ancestral
                 protein reconstruction methods, we performed computational
                 population evolution simulations featuring near-neutral
                 evolution under purifying selection, speciation, and
                 divergence using an off-lattice protein model where fitness
                 depends on the ability to be stable in a specified target
                 structure. We were thus able to compare the thermodynamic
                 properties of the true ancestral sequences with the properties
                 of ``ancestral sequences'' inferred by maximum parsimony,
                 maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods. Surprisingly, we
                 found that methods such as maximum parsimony and maximum
                 likelihood that reconstruct a ``best guess'' amino acid at
                 each position overestimate thermostability, while a Bayesian
                 method that sometimes chooses less-probable residues from the
                 posterior probability distribution does not. Maximum
                 likelihood and maximum parsimony apparently tend to eliminate
                 variants at a position that are slightly detrimental to
                 structural stability simply because such detrimental variants
                 are less frequent. Other properties of ancestral proteins
                 might be similarly overestimated. This suggests that ancestral
                 reconstruction studies require greater care to come to
                 credible conclusions regarding functional evolution. Inferred
                 functional patterns that mimic reconstruction bias should be

  abstract    = "Ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) is widely used to
                 formulate and test hypotheses about the sequences, functions,
                 and structures of ancient genes. Ancestral sequences are
                 usually inferred from an alignment of extant sequences using a
                 maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic algorithm, which
                 calculates the most likely ancestral sequence assuming a
                 probabilistic model of sequence evolution and a specific
                 phylogeny--typically the tree with the ML. The true phylogeny
                 is seldom known with certainty, however. ML methods ignore
                 this uncertainty, whereas Bayesian methods incorporate it by
                 integrating the likelihood of each ancestral state over a
                 distribution of possible trees. It is not known whether
                 Bayesian approaches to phylogenetic uncertainty improve the
                 accuracy of inferred ancestral sequences. Here, we use
                 simulation-based experiments under both simplified and
                 empirically derived conditions to compare the accuracy of ASR
                 carried out using ML and Bayesian approaches. We show that
                 incorporating phylogenetic uncertainty by integrating over
                 topologies very rarely changes the inferred ancestral state
                 and does not improve the accuracy of the reconstructed
                 ancestral sequence. Ancestral state reconstructions are robust
                 to uncertainty about the underlying tree because the

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is increasingly used
                 in diagnostics and surveillance of infectious diseases. A
                 major application for WGS is to use the data for identifying
                 outbreak clusters, and there is therefore a need for methods
                 that can accurately and efficiently infer phylogenies from
                 sequencing reads. In the present study we describe a new
                 dataset that we have created for the purpose of benchmarking
                 such WGS-based methods for epidemiological data, and also
                 present an analysis where we use the data to compare the
                 performance of some current methods. RESULTS: Our aim was to
                 create a benchmark data set that mimics sequencing data of the
                 sort that might be collected during an outbreak of an
                 infectious disease. This was achieved by letting an E. coli
                 hypermutator strain grow in the lab for 8 consecutive days,
                 each day splitting the culture in two while also collecting
                 samples for sequencing. The result is a data set consisting of
                 101 whole genome sequences with known phylogenetic
                 relationship. Among the sequenced samples 51 correspond to
                 internal nodes in the phylogeny because they are ancestral,
                 while the remaining 50 correspond to leaves. We also used the
                 newly created data set to compare three different online
                 available methods that infer phylogenies from whole-genome
                 sequencing reads: NDtree, CSI Phylogeny and REALPHY. One
                 complication when comparing the output of these methods with
                 the known phylogeny is that phylogenetic methods typically
                 build trees where all observed sequences are placed as leafs,
                 even though some of them are in fact ancestral. We therefore
                 devised a method for post processing the inferred trees by
                 collapsing short branches (thus relocating some leafs to
                 internal nodes), and also present two new measures of tree
                 similarity that takes into account the identity of both
                 internal and leaf nodes. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this analysis
                 we find that, among the investigated methods, CSI Phylogeny
                 had the best performance, correctly identifying 73\% of all
                 branches in the tree and 71\% of all clades. We have made all
                 data from this experiment (raw sequencing reads, consensus
                 whole-genome sequences, as well as descriptions of the known
                 phylogeny in a variety of formats) publicly available, with
                 the hope that other groups may find this data useful for
                 benchmarking and exploring the performance of epidemiological
                 methods. All data is freely available at:

                 repertoire analysis. However, benchmarking these newly

                 is often the only feasible way to benchmark new

                 The resulting mutational landscape demonstrates that large

                 mutation at this site optimizes both antigen affinity and

We therefore developed a single-cell barcoding technology for deep characterization of TILs without the need for cell-sorting or culture. Our emulsion-based method captures full-length, natively paired B-cell and T-cell receptor (BCR and TCR) sequences from lymphocytes among millions of input cells. We validated the method with 3 million B-cells from healthy human blood and 350,000 B-cells from an HIV elite controller, before processing 400,000 cells from an unsorted dissociated ovarian adenocarcinoma and recovering paired BCRs and TCRs from over 11,000 TILs. We then extended the barcoding method to detect DNA-labeled antibodies, allowing ultra-high throughput, simultaneous protein detection and RNA sequencing from single cells.},

Germinal centers in lymphoid organs are now recognized to be critically involved in this phenomenon, known as antibody affinity maturation. As well as improving in affinity for specific epitopes, some antibody responses maintain or even increase their breadth of antigen-recognition over time. This has led to another intense line of research aimed at understanding how broadly neutralizing anti-pathogen responses are generated. Recent work indicates that germinal centers also play an important role in the diversification process. We discuss current understanding of how germinal centers are programmed to support both affinity maturation and antibody diversification.}, journal={Current opinion in immunology}, author={Bannard, Oliver and Cyster, Jason G.}, year={2017}, month={Jan}, pages={21–30}}

Secondary changes in antibody repertoires after vaccine boosts suggest progressive rediversification of B cell receptors (BCRs), but the underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. Here, the integrated specificity and function of individual memory B cell progeny revealed ongoing evolution of polyclonal antibody specificities through germinal center (GC)-specific transcriptional activity. At the clonal and subclonal levels, single-cell expression of the genes encoding the costimulatory molecule CD83 and the DNA polymerase Polη segregated the secondary GC transcriptional program into four stages that regulated divergent mechanisms of memory BCR evolution. Our studies demonstrate that vaccine boosts reactivate a cyclic program of GC function in class-switched memory B cells to remodel existing antibody specificities and enhance durable immunological protection.}, number={3}, journal={Nature immunology}, publisher={nature.com}, author={McHeyzer-Williams, Louise J. and Milpied, Pierre J. and Okitsu, Shinji L. and McHeyzer-Williams, Michael G.}, year={2015}, month={Mar}, pages={296–305}}

We found here that light-zone (LZ) GC B cells with B cell antigen receptors (BCRs) of lower affinity were prone to enter the memory B cell pool. Mechanistically, cells in this memory-prone fraction had higher expression of the transcriptional repressor Bach2 than that of their counterparts with BCRs of higher affinity. Haploinsufficiency of Bach2 resulted in reduced generation of memory B cells, independently of suppression of the gene encoding the transcription factor Blimp-1. Bach2 expression in GC cells was inversely correlated with the strength of help provided by T cells. Thus, we propose an instructive model in which weak help from T cells maintains relatively high expression of Bach2, which predisposes GC cells to enter the memory pool.}, number={7}, journal={Nature immunology}, author={Shinnakasu, Ryo and Inoue, Takeshi and Kometani, Kohei and Moriyama, Saya and Adachi, Yu and Nakayama, Manabu and Takahashi, Yoshimasa and Fukuyama, Hidehiro and Okada, Takaharu and Kurosaki, Tomohiro}, year={2016}, month={Jul}, pages={861–869}}

Here we provide evidence for a complementary mechanism: retaining autoantibodies in the repertoire displayed as low levels of IgM and high IgD on anergic B cells, masking a varying proportion of autoantibody-binding sites with carbohydrates, and removing their self-reactivity by somatic hypermutation and selection in germinal centers (GCs). Analysis of human antibody sequences by deep sequencing of isotype-switched memory B cells or in IgG antibodies elicited against allogeneic RhD+ erythrocytes, vaccinia virus, rotavirus, or tetanus toxoid provides evidence for reactivation of anergic IgM(low) IgD+ IGHV4-34+ B cells and removal of cold agglutinin self-reactivity by hypermutation, often accompanied by mutations that inactivated an N-linked glycosylation sequon in complementarity-determining region 2 (CDR2). In a Hy10 antibody transgenic model where anergic B cells respond to a biophysically defined lysozyme epitope displayed on both foreign and self-antigens, cell transfers revealed that anergic IgM(low) IgD+ B cells form twice as many GC progeny as naïve IgM(hi) IgD+ counterparts. Their GC progeny were rapidly selected for CDR2 mutations that blocked 72\% of antigen-binding sites with N-linked glycan, decreased affinity 100-fold, and then cleared the binding sites of blocking glycan. These results provide evidence for a mechanism to acquire self/non-self discrimination by somatic mutation away from self-reactivity, and reveal how varying the efficiency of N-glycosylation provides a mechanism to modulate antibody avidity.}, number={25}, journal={Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America}, publisher={National Acad Sciences}, author={Sabouri, Zahra and Schofield, Peter and Horikawa, Keisuke and Spierings, Emily and Kipling, David and Randall, Katrina L. and Langley, David and Roome, Brendan and Vazquez-Lombardi, Rodrigo and Rouet, Romain and et al.}, year={2014}, month={Jun}, pages={E2567–75}}

To resolve long-standing questions, we have developed an in vivo assay to study AID targeting of passenger sequences replacing a V exon. First, we find AID targets SHM hotspots within V exon and S region passengers at similar frequencies and that the normal SHM process frequently generates deletions, indicating that SHM and CSR employ the same mechanism. Second, AID mutates targets in diverse non-Ig passengers in GC B cells at levels similar to those of V exons, definitively establishing the V exon location as “privileged” for SHM. Finally, Peyer’s patch GC B cells generate a reservoir of V exons that are highly mutated before selection for affinity maturation.

 @article{Reshetova_2017, title={Computational Model Reveals Limited Correlation between Germinal Center B-Cell Subclone Abundancy and Affinity: Implications for Repertoire Sequencing}, volume={8}, ISSN={1664-3224}, url={http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fimmu.2017.00221/full}, DOI={10.3389/fimmu.2017.00221}, abstractNote={Immunoglobulin repertoire sequencing has successfully been applied to identify expanded antigen-activated B-cell clones that play a role in the pathogenesis of immune disorders. One challenge is the selection of the Ag-specific B cells from the measured repertoire for downstream analyses. A general feature of an immune response is the expansion of specific clones resulting in a set of subclones with common ancestry varying in abundance and in the number of acquired somatic mutations. The expanded subclones are expected to have BCR affinities for the Ag higher than the affinities of the naive B cells in the background population. For these reasons several groups successfully proceeded or suggested selecting highly abundant subclones from the repertoire to obtain the Ag-specific B-cells. Given the nature of affinity maturation one would expect that abundant subclones are of high affinity but since repertoire sequencing only provides information about abundancies, this can only be verified with additional experiments, which are very labor-intensive. Moreover, this would also require knowledge of the Ag which is often not available for clinical samples. Consequently, in general we do not know if the selected highly abundant subclone(s) are also the high(est) affinity subclones. Such knowledge would likely improve the selection of relevant subclones for further characterization and Ag screening. Therefore, to gain insight in the relation between subclone abundancy and affinity we developed a computational model that simulates affinity maturation in a single GC while tracking individual subclones in terms of abundancy and affinity. We show that the model correctly captures the overall GC dynamics, and that the amount of expansion is qualitatively comparable to expansion observed from B cells isolated from human lymph nodes. Analysis of the fraction of high- and low-affinity subclones among of the unexpanded and expanded subclones reveals a limited correlation between abundancy and affinity and shows that the low abundant subclones are of highest affinity. Thus, our model suggests that selecting highly abundant subclones from repertoire sequencing experiments would not always lead to the high(est) affinity B cells. Consequently, additional or alternative selection approaches need to be applied.}, journal={Frontiers in immunology}, publisher={Frontiers}, author={Reshetova, Polina and van Schaik, Barbera D.

 @article{Shahaf_2008, title={Antigen-driven selection in germinal centers as reflected by the shape characteristics of immunoglobulin gene lineage trees: a large-scale simulation study}, volume={255}, ISSN={0022-5193}, abstractNote={During the immune response, the generation of memory B lymphocytes in germinal centers involves affinity maturation of the cells’ antigen receptors, based on somatic hypermutation of receptor genes and antigen-driven selection of the resulting mutants. Affinity maturation is vital for immune protection, and is the basis of humoral immune learning and memory. Lineage trees of somatically hypermutated immunoglobulin genes often serve to qualitatively illustrate claims concerning the dynamics of affinity maturation in germinal centers. Here, we derive the quantitative relationships between parameters characterizing affinity maturation dynamics (proliferation, differentiation and mutation rates, initial affinity of the Ig to the antigen, and selection thresholds) and the mathematical properties of lineage trees, using a computer simulation which combines mathematical models for all mature B cell populations, stochastic models of hypermutation and selection, lineage tree generation and measurement of graphical tree characteristics. We identified seven key lineage tree properties, and found correlations of these with initial clone affinity and with the selection threshold. These two parameters were found to be the main factors affecting lineage tree shapes in both primary and secondary response trees. The results also confirm that recycling from centrocytes back to centroblasts is highly likely.}, number={2}, journal={Journal of theoretical biology}, author={Shahaf, Gitit and Barak, Michal and Zuckerman, Neta S. and Swerdlin, Naamah and Gorfine, Malka and Mehr, Ramit}, year={2008}, month={Nov}, pages={210–222}}

 @article{Chaudhury_2014, title={Simulation of B cell affinity maturation explains enhanced antibody cross-reactivity induced by the polyvalent malaria vaccine AMA1}, volume={193}, ISSN={0022-1767}, abstractNote={Polyvalent vaccines use a mixture of Ags representing distinct pathogen strains to induce an immune response that is cross-reactive and protective. However, such approaches often have mixed results, and it is unclear how polyvalency alters the fine specificity of the Ab response and what those consequences might be for protection. In this article, we present a coarse-grain theoretical model of B cell affinity maturation during monovalent and polyvalent vaccinations that predicts the fine specificity and cross-reactivity of the Ab response. We stochastically simulate affinity maturation using a population dynamics approach in which the host B cell repertoire is represented explicitly, and individual B cell subpopulations undergo rounds of stimulation, mutation, and differentiation. Ags contain multiple epitopes and are present in subpopulations of distinct pathogen strains, each with varying degrees of cross-reactivity at the epitope level. This epitope- and strain-specific model of affinity maturation enables us to study the composition of the polyclonal response in granular detail and identify the mechanisms driving serum specificity and cross-reactivity. We applied this approach to predict the Ab response to a polyvalent vaccine based on the highly polymorphic malaria Ag apical membrane antigen-1. Our simulations show how polyvalent apical membrane Ag-1 vaccination alters the selection pressure during affinity maturation to favor cross-reactive B cells to both conserved and strain-specific epitopes and demonstrate how a polyvalent vaccine with a small number of strains and only moderate allelic coverage may be broadly neutralizing. Our findings suggest that altered fine specificity and enhanced cross-reactivity may be a universal feature of polyvalent vaccines.}, number={5}, journal={Journal of immunology }, author={Chaudhury, Sidhartha and Reifman, Jaques and Wallqvist, Anders}, year={2014}, month={Sep}, pages={2073–2086}}

 @article{Wang_Mata_2015, title={Manipulating the selection forces during affinity maturation to generate cross-reactive HIV antibodies}, volume={160}, ISSN={0092-8674}, abstractNote={Generation of potent antibodies by a mutation-selection process called affinity maturation is a key component of effective immune responses. Antibodies that protect against highly mutable pathogens must neutralize diverse strains. Developing effective immunization strategies to drive their evolution requires understanding how affinity maturation happens in an environment where variants of the same antigen are present. We present an in silico model of affinity maturation driven by antigen variants which reveals that induction of cross-reactive antibodies often occurs with low probability because conflicting selection forces, imposed by different antigen variants, can frustrate affinity maturation. We describe how variables such as temporal pattern of antigen administration influence the outcome of this frustrated evolutionary process. Our calculations predict, and experiments in mice with variant gp120 constructs of the HIV envelope protein confirm, that sequential immunization with antigen variants is preferred over a cocktail for induction of cross-reactive antibodies focused on the shared CD4 binding site epitope.}, number={4}, journal={Cell}, author={Wang, Shenshen and Mata-Fink, Jordi and Kriegsman, Barry and Hanson, Melissa and Irvine, Darrell J. and Eisen, Herman N. and Burton, Dennis R. and Wittrup, K.
